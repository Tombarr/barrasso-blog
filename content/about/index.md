Hi, I'm Tom Barrasso. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm a software engineer passionate about code, culture, and creativity. This blog is where I share my thoughts on technology, development practices, and the occasional creative experiment.

When I'm not writing code or blog posts, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or thinking about the intersection of technology and human experience.

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:blog@barrasso.me) or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tombarr).
