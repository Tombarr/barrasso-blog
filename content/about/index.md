# Hi, I'm Tom Barrasso 👋

{{< br >}}
I’ve been building digital experiences for years. I have launched products for some of the biggest and most respected brands, managed and mentored engineers and program managers, and ran cross-functional programs across large-scale organizations.

{{< br >}}
I code, write, speak, climb, mentor, practice, listen, read, run, encourage, travel, and much more.

## My process

{{< section class="svg-container spiral-container" >}}
{{< svg path="images/celtic-knot.svg" class="spiral-knot" >}}
{{< /section >}}

{{< br >}}
Like this Celtic spiral knot, triads, triplicities, and the [rule of three](https://www.flowresearchcollective.com/blog/the-rule-of-three-the-brain) shows up in many places. The Holy Trinity in Catholicism: the father, son, and holy spirit. The Trimurti in Hinduism: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. In space: x, y, and z, and in time: past, present, and future.

{{< br >}}
**People • Process • Programming**. I start with People: their interests, inspirations, and incentives that connect and motivate individual action. Then I focus on Process: the rules, rituals, and repetitions that foster cooperation and collective action. Lastly, I turn my attention to Programming: code (dev environment), compilation (build, test + deploy), and cloud (runtime & execution).

## About this site

{{< br >}}
The blob on the homepage is a [metaball](https://medium.com/@tbarrasso/pretty-svg-metaballs-f8d2a4c6f594), something I built back in 2017 at Maark while building data visualizations like the [Morningstar™ Style Box](https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/apac/au/pdfs/Legal/Stylebox_Factsheet.pdf) in the Fund Compare Tool on [John Hancock Investments]({{< relref "projects/jhinvestments" >}}). My [resume]({{< relref "resume/tom" >}}) is [typeset in HTML](https://github.com/Tombarr/html-resume-template), based on a version I created in 2018. Although this is a static website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), much of this website explores randomness. So the version you are experiencing will likely never exist exactly as it does right now.
