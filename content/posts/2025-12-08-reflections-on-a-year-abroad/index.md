For a year I got to experience **truly "remote" work.**

Between Summer 2024 to Fall 2025, I spent nearly a year traveling across Peru, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, India, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Cyprus, and _almost_ half a year living in a van in New Zealand.

During this time, I worked remotely at [CloudMosa](https://puffin.com) as the Head of Developer Relations for [Cloud Phone](https://www.cloudphone.tech). Although my interest in flip phones began in 2020 when I launched [PodLP]({{< relref "projects/podlp" >}}), this was quite the departure from the past 5+ years in Big Tech living in Seattle. This writing is part of the long journey to unpack and make meaning from such a profound experience.

## Aotearoa New Zealand 🇳🇿

_Isolation, postcard-quality sunsets, striking mountains, flightless birds, solid 4G signal, and the kindest people I've ever met_

I've worked with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (the static site generator) for years. This blog is built with Hugo, and so is [Cloud Phone for Developers]({{< relref "projects/cloud-phone" >}}). Ironically, our van came with the name "Hugo." Fortunately, Hugo survived another 10,000km around the North & South Islands, and thanks to an [Asus 4G-AX56](https://amzn.to/3MygIHE) (powered by rooftop solar), I had WiFi wherever I went using the [Spark](https://www.spark.co.nz/) network.

A 12 hour flight from San Francisco: New Zealand has no dangerous animals, no land borders, and it's often [omitted from maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapsWithoutNZ/). I've been to dark-sky preserves, but New Zealand is on another level. This is just a several second exposure on an [iPhone 13 Mini](https://amzn.to/4oTQL3k).

{{< responsive-image src="southern-sky.jpeg" alt="Night sky in the Southern Hemisphere" caption="Night sky in the Southern Hemisphere" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

Run by the Department of Conservation (DOC), New Zealand's [Great Walks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/great-walks/) were one of the initial draws to visit the islands. Of the 11 Great Walks, I completed 4 and hiked partway across another 5. In between tramping trips I dropped by the [Nelson Dev Group](https://www.meetup.com/nelson-dev-group/) and gave a talk at [Ruby Nights Auckland](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juan-luis-ramirez_rubynights-aucklandtech-activity-7320402927104274432-LQs0). I launched the [Cloud Phone for Developers](https://developer.cloudphone.tech/) website, was a guest on the [WasmAssembly Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFXJpbJMFr4), and helped launch the MyGP app for [Grameenphone](https://www.grameenphone.com/), Bangladesh's largest telecommunication company.

No doubt, New Zealand is weird. It's home to hobbits, alpine parrots, spherical [concretions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moeraki_Boulders), and [Steampunk HQ](https://www.steampunkoamaru.co.nz/). I saw the world's smallest Pengiuns and walked up the world's [steepest street](https://www.treehugger.com/worlds-steepest-streets-4869323#list-sc__content_1-0). I tried [Amazake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazake), witnessed [glowworms](https://www.newzealand.com/us/glow-worms/), got into [F45](https://f45training.com/), and picked up a few Māori phrases.

I drove on the left, lived in other people's homes (house sitting), and had my first run-in with rites of passage.

This was definitely a departure from riding the corporate shuttle, responding to hundreds of [Workplace](https://www.workplace.com/) messages, and providing status updates at the semi-annual All Hands meeting. In many ways, I was now confronted with the [paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice).

Maya Angelou wrote that, "people will never forget how you made them feel." I will never forget the feeling of being as far as humanly possible from the [culture of busyness](https://hbr.org/2023/03/beware-a-culture-of-busyness). The feeling when ducks and [weka](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/weka/) were my only coworkers. The feeling when projects were punctuated by a swim in a brisk alpine lake.

It's more than just the question: "live to work or work to live?" The balance between under and overworked isn't a fixed point. In Safi Bahcall's book _[Loonshots](https://amzn.to/4a2EYLV)_, he attempts to quantify the conditions under which return-on-politics exceeds return-on-work. At larger companies, I've observed the primary motivation was compensation, and the primary form of communication was meetings. Being truly "remote" at CloudMosa, meetings were rare and the driving force I saw was **the satisfaction of seeing your work help real people.**

This was an email a user sent me. Five years ago, I built PodLP because it was something I wanted myself. I continued building it for the same reason that CloudMosa builds Cloud Phone. PodLP turned into an (admittedly small) business that continues to this day.

Although sponsorship revenue keeps PodLP profitable, no doubt I won't look back and smile at every invoice. But **I'll never forget unsolicited feedback like this.**

## The next chapter: rest of world

Rest of world (ROW) is a pejorative commonly used at technology companies to mean everywhere outside of the US and Europe. I spent several weeks in each country, experiencing them more deeply than a typical American vacation but not to the same extent as New Zealand. Each place shaped my understanding of the world in ways I hadn't expected.

## Australia 🇦🇺

_Marsupials, meetups, speed cameras, and a sausage on election day_

{{< responsive-image src="kangaroo.jpeg" alt="Kangaroo near Brisbane, Australia" caption="Kangaroo near Brisbane, Australia" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

Growing up, I loved [Zoboomafoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoboomafoo) so naturally I was excited to visit the country full of strange animals. Yet it was _I_ who felt watched by the [insane speed enforcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsAustralia/comments/14npkny/is_speed_enforcement_in_australia_absurd_by/) cameras. After spending 6 months in small towns, it was jarring to return to large cities, many more populous than the entire country of New Zealand.

{{< responsive-image src="sydney-harbor.jpeg" alt="The Opera House in Sydney, Australia" caption="The Opera House in Sydney, Australia" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

I'm grateful to [Frontenders Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/vue-sydney/events/306581679/) for offering me the opportunity to present to 100+ developers, and for our hosts in Brisbane who prepared a classic Aussie Barbie (and so much more). Plus Australia is where I discovered [Jack Davies and The Bush Chooks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1a6a0hVxotITvRTjVXaT9n) at a last minute concert.

{{< responsive-image src="frontenders-sydney.jpeg" alt="Tom giving a talk at Frontenders Sydney in May 2025" caption="Tom giving a talk at [Frontenders Sydney](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frontenders-au_frontendersau-frontendcommunity-devevents-activity-7325651785300201472-BHQQ) in May 2025" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

I'd love to see America adopt the [democracy sausage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_sausage), and aspire to the return of politics summed up as ["boring" and "weird"](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdxgw9x44x8o). Yet I'm not called to return to Australia. Maybe it's the lack of prominent mountains, or abundance of deadly creatures. Maybe it's because I don't surf, or because I'm not interested in their [$1500 coffee](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/drink/western-sydney-cafe-offers-1500-cup-of-coffee-that-has-brought-people-to-tears/news-story/f8bb288402e3bae2fe75f8e46c83ff0e).

## Vietnam 🇻🇳

_Gastronomic excellence and highly-caffienated huslter culture_

{{< responsive-image src="vietnam-rice.jpeg" alt="Rice terraces in Pù Luông, Vietnam" caption="Rice terraces in Pù Luông, Vietnam" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

Vietnam is [growing fast](https://asiatimes.com/2025/12/vietnams-8-growth-making-a-mockery-of-trumps-tariffs/), and it's abundantly clear why. It's a place of hardcore hustle culture: operating an AirBnB, restaurant, nail salon, farming durian, brewing kombucha, and driving for Grab. Although the small demographic I encountered was biased towards tourism, it seems as if everyone run a business and has 3 jobs. After all, this is a place where [you can't put too much on a moped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmDntqkisi8).

{{< responsive-image src="vietnam-flip-phones.jpeg" alt="Old Vietnamese poster featuring flip phones" caption="Old Vietnamese poster featuring flip phones from a Cửa Hàng ĐTDĐ (mobile phone shop)" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

Vietnam is where I bought my first Cloud Phone in person, a [Viettel V1S 4G](https://developer.cloudfone.com/device/viettel_v_1_s/) for ₫390,000 (~$15 USD). I also saw real people using feature phones for practical purposes, not just as part of a "digital detox." CloudMosa also [donated 100 4G Cloud Phones](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cloudmosa_cloudphone-cloudup-csr-activity-7385986268461064192-thI2/) to provide connectivity to residents in remote areas of Vinh Long province.

{{< responsive-image src="vietnam-boats.jpeg" alt="Boats in Tràng An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site" caption="Boats in Tràng An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

If America runs on Dunkin, Vietnam runs on [Highland](https://www.highlandscoffee.com.vn/en/coffee.html). You can't escape their strong, sugary drinks. Nor should you. Vietnamese coffee is delicious and its how everyone keeps going day and night.

Outside of the cities, Vietnam's karst landscapes are stunning. Limestone towers jut out of nowhere, and rice terraces sprawl as far as the eye can see. Yet the price of progress goes beyond caffeine addiction. Smog (especially in Hanoi) and serious litter pollution are everywhere. Venture slightly off the beaten path and the ocean hardly looks safe to swim.

## Thailand 🇹🇭

_Mangosteen, meditation, and mud houses_

{{< responsive-image src="lotus-flower.jpeg" alt="Lotus flower near Chiang Mai, Thailand" caption="Lotus flower near Chiang Mai, Thailand" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

My time in Thailand was intentionally slow. I enjoyed [mangosteen-shaped ice cream](https://faerieimps.blogspot.com/2017/09/icedea.html) (my favorite fruit), joined a yoga retreat, and took impromptu lessons on how to build houses out of clay bricks. As Lao Tzu put it, "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." While I raced from rice paddy to museum to coffee stand to hawker market in Vietnam, I reconnected and recalibrated in Chiang Mai and Bangkok.

## India 🇮🇳

_Rick Steves favorite and the "keypad mobile" capital_

{{< responsive-image src="kochi-monsoon.jpeg" alt="Monsoon season in Kochi, India" caption="Monsoon season in Kochi, India" class="w-full no-border contain" >}}

Although my time was spent in Kerala (often billed as ["India Lite"](https://www.fathomaway.com/colorful-india-photo-tour/)), it was still quite intense. But this was one of those times when I thrived on the chaos. I roamed the streets of Kochi by rickshaw and public transport: buses, trains, and even ferries. I even found plenty of my [beloved mangosteen](https://www.civilsocietyonline.com/agriculture/mangosteen-bonanza-in-kerala-village/).

> When asked my favorite country, I say, "India." While I enjoy the shock value of saying that, that’s not why I say it. I say India because it’s true. India wallops anyone’s self-assuredness. India rearranged my cultural furniture. My confidence that I understood such basics to life as time, joy, love, pain, and music was shaken. I was humbled in a way that made me a better person.{{< br >}}
> – [Rick Steves](https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/tag/india/)

Much to the chagrin of many a mobile store salesperson, I had no interest in the latest Huawei Mate or iPhone. Eventually I bought what you can't find on eBay: feature phones (mostly called "keypad mobiles" in India) like a [Snexian Guru 4G](https://developer.cloudfone.com/device/snexian_guru_4_g/) and one of the very first Cloud Phone models, an [Itel Super Guru 4G](https://developer.cloudfone.com/device/itel_it9020/).
