Between Summer 2024 to Fall 2025, I spent nearly a year traveling across Peru, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, India, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Cyprus, and _almost_ half a year living in a van in New Zealand.

During this time, I worked remotely at [CloudMosa](https://puffin.com) as the Head of Developer Relations for [Cloud Phone](https://www.cloudphone.tech). Although my interest in flip phones began in 2020 when I launched [PodLP]({{< relref "projects/podlp" >}}), this was quite the departure from the past 5+ years in Big Tech living in Seattle. This writing is part of the long journey to unpack and make meaning from such a profound experience.

## New Zealand 🇳🇿

_Isolation, postcard-quality sunsets, striking mountains, flightless birds, solid 4G signal, and the kindest people I've ever met_

I've worked with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (the static site generator) for years. This blog is built with Hugo, and so is [Cloud Phone for Developers]({{< relref "projects/cloud-phone" >}}). Ironically, our van came with the name "Hugo." Fortunately, Hugo survived another 10,000km around the North & South Islands, and thanks to an [Asus 4G-AX56](https://amzn.to/3MygIHE) (powered by rooftop solar), we had WiFi pretty much wherever we went using the [Spark](https://www.spark.co.nz/) network.

A 12 hour flight from San Francisco: New Zealand has no dangerous animals, no land borders, and it's often [omitted from maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapsWithoutNZ/). I've been to dark-sky preserves, but New Zealand is on another level. This is just a several second exposure on an [iPhone 13 Mini](https://amzn.to/4oTQL3k).

Run by the Department of Conservation (DOC), New Zealand's [Great Walks](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/great-walks/) were one of the initial draws to visit the islands. Of the 11 Great Walks, we completed 4 and hiked partway across another 5. In between tramping trips I dropped by the [Nelson Dev Group](https://www.meetup.com/nelson-dev-group/) and gave a talk at [Ruby Nights Auckland](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juan-luis-ramirez_rubynights-aucklandtech-activity-7320402927104274432-LQs0). I launched the [Cloud Phone for Developers](https://developer.cloudphone.tech/) website, was a guest on the [WasmAssembly Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFXJpbJMFr4), and helped launch the MyGP app for [Grameenphone](https://www.grameenphone.com/), Bangladesh's largest telecommunication company.

No doubt, New Zealand is weird. It's home to hobbits, alpine parrots, spherical [concretions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moeraki_Boulders), and [Steampunk HQ](https://www.steampunkoamaru.co.nz/). I saw the world's smallest Pengiuns and walked up the world's [steepest street](https://www.treehugger.com/worlds-steepest-streets-4869323#list-sc__content_1-0). I tried [Amazake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazake), witnessed [glowworms](https://www.newzealand.com/us/glow-worms/), got into [F45](https://f45training.com/), and picked up a few Māori phrases.

I drove on the left, lived in other people's homes (house sitting), and had my first run-in with rites of passage.

This was definitely a departure from riding the corporate shuttle, responding to hundreds of [Workplace](https://www.workplace.com/) messages, and providing status updates at the semi-annual All Hands meeting. In many ways, I was now confronted with the [paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice).

Maya Angelou said that, "people will never forget how you made them feel." I will never forget the feeling far from the [culture of busyness](https://hbr.org/2023/03/beware-a-culture-of-busyness), when ducks and [weka](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/weka/) were my only coworkers and projects were punctuated by a swim in a brisk alpine lake. It's more than just "live to work or work to live." The balance between under and overworked is in constant motion. In the past year, I've both forged and forgot about relationships.

Five years ago, I built PodLP because it was something I wanted myself. It turned into an (admittedly small) business that continues to this day. While I'll eventually forget about the sponsorship revenue, no doubt I won't forget the unsolicited feedback I received like this.
