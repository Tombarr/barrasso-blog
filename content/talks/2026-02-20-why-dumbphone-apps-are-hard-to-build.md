On Jose Briones' [Moving Offline](https://josebriones.substack.com/) Podcast, I talk about [PodLP](https://podlp.com), and how the podcast app for dumbphones was made. We dive into why it’s tough to find your favorite apps on these minimalist devices, and what inspired me to build PodLP during the pandemic. We cover the challenges developers face like small screens, keypad navigation, and platform fragmentation, and discuss why big companies aren't rushing into the dumbphone movement.
