I led the front-end team launching the redesigned [John Hancock Investments](https://jhinvestments.com) website, including the interactive [Fund Compare](https://www.jhinvestments.com/viewpoints/portfolio-construction/comparing-funds-in-three-easy-steps) tool. Complex financial data was rendered precisely using custom **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/)** charts and dynamic SVGs. Downloadable Fact Sheets were rendered using Puppeteer to month and quarter-end PDFs. I collaborated with our backend team, often landing backend changes in **Adobe Experience Manager** (AEM) to ensure a timely and pixel-perfect delivery for our client.
