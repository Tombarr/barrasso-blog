Launched in September 2011, StatusBar+ was the first Android app that I published, achieving **500,000+ installs**. It was also Android's first status bar replacement app that didn't require jailbreaking or root access! StatusBar+ used the [`WindowManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager) API to draw _on top_ of the system status bar. Originally themed like Windows Phone 7, StatusBar+ expanded to offer many more features and themes. StatusBar+ was eventually sold on [Apptopia](https://apptopia.com/en/) (later Fliptopia) in 2012, a marketplace to buy and sell apps.
