Cloud Phone is a Chromium-based remote browser from CloudMosa, the company behind the [Puffin](https://puffin.com) browser. Cloud Phone lets users watch YouTube and TikTok on budget features phones with as little as 16MB RAM! As the Head of Developer Relations, I designed, authored, and built the [Cloud Phone for Developers](https://developer.cloudfone.com) website, made [guest appearances]({{< relref "talks" >}}) on podcasts, filmed and published content, developed reference applications, and supported many Cloud Phone developers.

{{< br >}}
Cloud Phone for Developers is a static website generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom [Doks](https://getdoks.org/)-based theme.
