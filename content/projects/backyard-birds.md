Backyard Birds is an educational app created for the [Yoto Player](https://us.yotoplay.com/yoto-player), a screen-free audio platform for kids. Backyard Birds brings the magic of birdwatching to children and families through personalized audio cards. The app uses AI to write and narrate stories featuring birds recently sighted nearby, complete with authentic bird calls, interesting facts, and vibrant icons.
