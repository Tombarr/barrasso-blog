Cloud Phone is a Chromium-based remote browser from CloudMosa, the company behind the [Puffin](https://puffin.com) browser. Cloud Phone lets users watch YouTube and TikTok on budget features phones with as little as 16MB RAM! As the **Head of Developer Relations**, I designed, authored, and built the [Cloud Phone for Developers](https://developer.cloudfone.com) website, made [guest appearances]({{< relref "talks" >}}) on podcasts, filmed and [published content](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudPhone-CloudMosa/shorts), developed [reference applications](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Acloudphone+org%3Acloudmosa+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories), and supported many Cloud Phone developers.

Cloud Phone for Developers is a static website generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom [Doks](https://getdoks.org/)-based theme and [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). It's continuously checked for [typos](https://crates.io/crates/typos) and updated via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Screenshots, code snippets, and resources are based on the feedback of developers from around the world including India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam, South Africa, and the United States.

## **Reference Applications**

{{< br >}}
I built open-source reference applications like a [Currency Converter](https://github.com/cloudmosa/cloudphone-currency), wrote [companion tutorials](https://developer.cloudfone.com/docs/walkthroughs/currency-converter/), and published them on Cloud Phone. This expands the app catalog for users with valuable utilities while providing a real-world codebase to showcase an effective, platform-specific user experience for developers.
