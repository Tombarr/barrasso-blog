For an internship I developed a prototype of [TextMyFood](https://www.linkedin.com/company/textmyfood), a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) service integrated with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to let restaurant customers text their waiter to request another round of beer, a new fork, the check, whatever. A decade before the COVID-19 pandemic made QR code menus ubiquitous, TextMyFood was piloted at [Charlie's Kitchen](https://charlieskitchen.com/) in Cambridge, MA in an attempt to balance lax vs overly-attentive service using simple, readily-available technology.
