Noyze was the first volume panel replacement app for Android. Leveraging the new [`AccessibilityService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) API, Noyze could override how the system responds to volume buttons, providing a themed extensive with endless customization options. Noyze added playback and multi-channel controls, along with the ability to launch apps by long pressing volume up or down.
