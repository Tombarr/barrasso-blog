Inspired by early designs from Xaiomi's custom Android ROM, [MIUI](https://www.mi.com/global/miui), ChargeBar added a thin line on top of your status bar indicating battery charge. ChargeBar surpassed 1M+ installs and was featured on the likes of [Life Hacker](https://lifehacker.com/chargebar-gives-you-a-closer-look-at-your-androids-curr-5886706), [Redmond Pie](https://www.redmondpie.com/chargebar-for-android-is-an-miui-inspired-battery-bar-that-works-on-all-roms/), and [Droid Life](https://www.droid-life.com/2012/02/20/chargebar-brings-a-visual-battery-meter-to-the-top-or-bottom-of-home-screens/).

ChargeBar was sold on [Apptopia](https://apptopia.com/en/) (later Fliptopia) in 2012, a marketplace to buy and sell apps.
