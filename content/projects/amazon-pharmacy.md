As a Software Development Engineer (SDE), I built the real-time engine to calculate, collect, reconcile, and audit sales tax at [PillPack](https://www.pillpack.com/) and Amazon Pharmacy, part of the HIPAA covered entities for Amazon Health Services. As a Technical Program Manager (TPM), I led application security certification across many healthcare services. I led threat modeling, penetration testing (red teamimg), vulnerability triaging, incident response, and remediation.
